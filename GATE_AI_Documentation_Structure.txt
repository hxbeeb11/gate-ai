Initial questions are sourced from curated educational content across multiple GATE subjects. Raw data is stored in JSON format in the data/raw directory, with a structured topics.json file defining subject hierarchies and key points for each topic.

### Database Schema and Organization
The database utilizes tables for mock_questions, diagram_questions, user_progress, and adaptive_state. Each question record contains fields for subject, question_type, options, correct_answer, and explanation with possible additional metadata.

### Question Format and Structure
Questions follow a consistent JSON structure across the system, with fields for question text, options array, correct_answer index, explanation text, and subject/topic tags. Diagram questions include additional SVG code fields for visual representations.

## 4. BERT Model Implementation

### Training Data Preparation
The GATEDataset class in train_bert.py transforms existing questions into tokenized inputs suitable for BERT. The prepare_data() function handles loading, cleaning, and organizing training data from various subjects before splitting into training and validation sets.

### Model Configuration and Parameters
The project utilizes a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) fine-tuned for question classification. Key parameters include a maximum sequence length of 512, learning rate optimization, and weighted loss functions to handle subject imbalance.

### Training Process and Optimization
Training involves multiple epochs with batch processing, gradient accumulation, and evaluation after each epoch. The train_bert_model() function implements early stopping based on validation accuracy and saves the best model checkpoint for future use.

### Classification Mechanism
The BERT model classifies questions based on learned patterns of language, structure, and content specific to each subject. It analyzes question text and extracts features that distinguish questions across different subjects and difficulty levels.

### Output Labels and Pattern Recognition
After training, the model generates labels.json with identified patterns and label_map.json mapping subjects to recognized patterns. These files are crucial for the question generator to maintain subject-specific question characteristics.

### Performance Metrics and Evaluation
The system tracks accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores during training. The evaluation process ensures the model reaches sufficient accuracy before deployment, with continuous monitoring for potential drift in classification performance.

## 5. Pattern Recognition System

### Subject-wise Pattern Identification
The BERT model identifies distinct linguistic patterns, terminology usage, question structures, and complexity indicators for each subject area. These patterns reflect the unique characteristics of questions in domains like Digital Logic, Computer Networks, etc.

### Label Generation and Mapping
The generate_labels_json() function creates structured representations of identified patterns, with label_map.json establishing connections between subjects and their characteristic question patterns. This mapping drives the question generation process.

### Pattern Storage and Retrieval
Patterns are stored in standardized JSON format for efficient retrieval during question generation. The system loads these patterns when initializing the question generator, ensuring new questions reflect subject-specific characteristics.

### Pattern Evolution and Refinement
The system supports periodic retraining of the BERT model as new questions are added to the database, allowing pattern recognition to evolve and improve with expanding data. Pattern refinement helps maintain question quality and relevance.

## 6. Question Generation Engine

### LLM Integration (Together AI)
The question_generator.py module connects to Together AI's API to access the Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free model, providing sophisticated natural language generation capabilities for creating contextually relevant questions.

### Prompt Engineering Techniques
Carefully crafted prompts in the _create_prompt() method guide the LLM to generate questions matching specific requirements. Prompts include subject context, key points, difficulty guidelines, and structural requirements to produce consistent outputs.

### Question Template Design
The system uses structured JSON templates for question generation, ensuring all required fields are included and properly formatted. Templates vary based on question type (multiple-choice, numerical, diagram) while maintaining consistency in core fields.

### Difficulty Level Calibration
Question complexity is calibrated using detailed difficulty guidelines (beginner, intermediate, advanced) embedded in prompts to the LLM. These guidelines specify conceptual depth, application requirements, and complexity factors appropriate for each level.

### Quality Assurance Mechanisms
Generated questions undergo validation checks for format compliance, content relevance, and difficulty alignment. Error handling mechanisms in the generate_questions_for_topic() function ensure only valid questions are presented to users.

## 7. Adaptive Learning Implementation

### User Progress Tracking
The system maintains detailed records of user interactions, correct/incorrect answers, and completion rates for each subject and difficulty level. Progress data is stored in the database for persistence across sessions.

### Difficulty Progression Algorithm
Users advance from beginner to intermediate to advanced levels based on performance thresholds (typically 70% correct answers). The adaptive system adjusts question difficulty appropriately to match user knowledge and learning progression.

### Personalized Learning Path Generation
Based on progress data, the system recommends topics for further study, prioritizing areas of weakness while ensuring comprehensive coverage of the syllabus. Learning paths adapt dynamically as users demonstrate mastery of concepts.

### Performance Analytics and Visualization
The dashboard presents visual representations of subject-wise progress, difficulty progression, and comparative performance metrics. These visualizations help users identify strengths and areas needing improvement at a glance.

## 8. Diagram Question System
